# AZSCO Assistant — API proxy

This is the only part of the repository that isn't the static site: a small
server-side proxy for the AZSCO Assistant chat widget, deployed separately
(Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, ...) from wherever the site itself is hosted.
Nothing here is served by GitHub Pages — the frontend (everything else in the
repo) is unaffected by anything in this folder.

> Calling an LLM directly from the browser (`CHAT_MODE = "direct"`) turned out
> not to work reliably in production — most providers' APIs do not support
> being called from an arbitrary website's browser (no CORS), so the widget
> opens but every reply fails. This proxy is the fix: it holds the key
> server-side and the browser talks to it instead, on a domain that can send
> the right headers.

> **Provider: Google Gemini**, via a free API key from

> started on Mistral, but its free tier rate-limits far too aggressively for
> live visitor traffic — a single test message could exhaust it. Gemini's free
> tier is built for exactly this kind of light, ongoing production use.

> Deploy one of the functions below, then set `CHAT_MODE = "proxy"` and
> `CHAT_ENDPOINT` in `tools/build.py` and rebuild.

This proxy adds the API key server-side, so it never reaches the browser.

## What to deploy

| File | For |
| --- | --- |
| `backend/api/chat.js` | Vercel, Netlify Functions, Deno Deploy — anything running a Node/Edge function |
| `backend/workers/chat-worker.js` | Cloudflare Workers |

## Environment variables

| Name | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | yes | From <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>. Set it as a secret, never in a file. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | no | Defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`. See <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models> for current free-tier models and rate limits. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | recommended | Comma-separated origins, e.g. `https://www.azsco.com`. Without it any site can call your endpoint and spend your quota. |

## Deploying on Vercel

Vercel auto-detects a top-level `api/` folder as serverless functions, but
that folder now lives at `backend/api/`. Set the project's **Root Directory**
to `backend` in the Vercel project settings (or pass `--cwd backend` /
run the commands from inside `backend/`) so it finds `api/chat.js`:

```bash
cd backend
vercel deploy
vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY         # paste the key when prompted
vercel env add ALLOWED_ORIGIN         # https://www.azsco.com
```

The function is then served at `/api/chat` on whatever domain Vercel gives
that deployment — a separate domain from the site itself, since GitHub Pages
hosts the site. Point `CHAT_ENDPOINT` in `tools/build.py` at that domain's
`/api/chat` URL.

## Deploying on Cloudflare Workers

`backend/workers/chat-worker.js` has no imports, so it can be deployed
straight from the dashboard with no CLI or Node install:

1. Sign up free at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up> if you don't have an
   account.
2. **Workers & Pages → Create → Create Worker.** Give it a name (e.g.
   `azsco-chat`) and deploy the default template.
3. **Edit code**, delete the placeholder, paste in the full contents of
   `workers/chat-worker.js`, then **Save and deploy**.
4. **Settings → Variables and Secrets → Add.** Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a
   *secret* with your free key from <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>.
   Optionally add `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` as a plain variable set to
   `https://www.azsco.com,https://azsco.com`. Save and deploy again.
5. Copy the worker's URL from the top of its dashboard page (looks like
   `https://azsco-chat.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`).
6. Set `CHAT_ENDPOINT` to that URL and `CHAT_MODE = "proxy"` in
   `tools/build.py`, then run `python3 tools/build.py`.

Prefer the command line instead:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy backend/workers/chat-worker.js --name azsco-chat
npx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY --name azsco-chat
```

Either way, keep this file's `FACTS` in sync by hand with `CHAT_FACTS` /
`CHAT_RULES` in `tools/build.py` and with `backend/api/chat.js` whenever the
business facts change — a deployed worker cannot read the static site's source.

## Checking it works

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-deployment>/api/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"lang":"en","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What services do you offer?"}]}'
```

A healthy response is `{"reply":"..."}`. If you get `{"error":"Assistant unavailable"}`,
check the function logs — the proxy deliberately does not return API errors to the
browser, so that key or quota problems are not exposed to visitors.

## Limits enforced by the proxy

- 1000 characters per message, 40 messages per request, 500 tokens per reply.
- Only `user` and `assistant` roles are accepted from the browser; the system
  prompt is added server-side and cannot be overridden by a visitor.

These are a first line of defence, not rate limiting. For a public site, also put
your host's rate limiting or WAF in front of the endpoint.
